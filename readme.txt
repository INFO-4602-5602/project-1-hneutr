## Notes:
I'm pretty confused about the "submissions directory" component of this assignment. I just left my code in the root of my directory. It should work if you have a server running from that directory. I've commented below on what I got working and what I didn't. I'm not really sure what else I'm supposed to do to "complete" the 'readme.txt', but I'm trying!

Note: I was really confused by the headings and content describing what to do for parts 2-4. I ended up putting my line graph in part 2 and putting the scatterplot in part 3, so that I could make it interactive for part 4. I apologize if that's not right!

## Part 1: Interpreting Data
I got this part working.

## Part 2: Building Scatterplots
As mentioned above, I put my linegraph here, as I thought that made the most
sense. I got this part working. I visualized the dataset called 'Anscombe II'.

## Part 3: Building Line Graphs
As mentioned above, I put my scatterplot here, as I though that made the most
sense. I got this part working. Again, I visualized the dataset called 'Anscombe II'.

## Part 4: Interaction
I got this part working. Clicking a point will cause a `p` tag to appear above the plot for Part 3. Hovering over a point will cause that point to turn red. It will also cause a tooltip to appear, but that is for the Tooltips bell.

## Part 5: Building Multiple Charts
I got this part working. I put the plots in a 2x2 grid, using CSS grid.

# Bells & Whistles

## Bell: Tooltips
I completed this "bell". Hover over points in Plot 3 to see the tooltips.

## Whistle: Transitions
I got this Whistle working. See below the plots for part 5.
